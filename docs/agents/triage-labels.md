# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the status strings used in this repo's issue tracker (the `Status:` field in `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/*.md`).

| Role in skills    | Status in our tracker | Meaning                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`     | `needs-triage`          | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue   |
| `needs-info`       | `needs-info`            | Waiting on reporter for more information  |
| `ready-for-agent`  | `ready-for-agent`       | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent   |
| `ready-for-human`  | `ready-for-human`       | Requires human implementation             |
| `wontfix`          | `wontfix`               | Will not be actioned                      |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding status string from this table.
